# Team Activities: Logic and Control Statements

Well to your first Team Activity (also called  "peer lab"). This is meant to be a time for the team to work through a tutorial like problem, asking questions and seeking better understanding. If you haven't already, make sure to read [The Guide to Quality Team Activities](https://github.com/CS5001-khoury/TeamActivities/blob/main/GuildToGoodTeamsActivities.md)  that was put together by students in past semesters. 




## Grading
Grades for team activities will be based on attendance and notes. You must attend, and as a team you need to generate notes that we can confirm your work. Ideally, you upload the notes as a PDF to the team meeting after you build them out or have a shared document everyone in the team meeting can see (including TAs and the instructor). 

> [!TIP] 
> Good notes become a study guide for you and your team! Make sure they include everything you need to help better understand the weekly material. 

### ⭐ Working in Teams ⭐
When working in teams, remember do not let one person do all the work. Make sure to work together, and ask questions. It is also better if different people program, and you all take turns programming for various team assignments.



## Last Task: Work on Coding-Practice
Make sure to work on the [Coding Practice Problems](https://github.com/CS5001-khoury/Resources/blob/main/PracticeProblems.md). Have each member of your group pick a different problem, and you will all work on your problems. Make sure to discuss your solution with the team, and paste your code to your *teams* meeting channel / upload the python .py file! 

At the end of every Team Activity, you will be encouraged to work on coding practice problems as a team. It is important you take this time to talk about solutions, approaches, and make suggestions to each other! You are building a skill needed for technical interviews, and like all new skills it is important to practice.  Some times do the practice problems after the meeting, but then use the chat to comment. Either is fine, but it is important to get feedback and ask questions. 


## Submission
There is no "submission" for the Team Activity. Make sure you have your notes for the meeting (can be a doc in the files section) in your team's meeting channel. The TAs will check the attendance logs and award points based on attendance and completed notes.
