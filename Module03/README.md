## Last Task: Work on Coding-Practice
Go ahead and open the coding practice at the end of module 02. Have each member of your group pick a different problem, and you will all work on your problems. Make sure to discuss your solution with the team, and past your code to your *teams* meeting channel! 

At the end of every Team Activity, you will be encouraged to work on coding practice problems as a team. It is important you take this time to talk about solutions, approaches, and make suggestions to each other! You are building a skill needed for technical interviews, and like all new skills it is important to practice. 


## Submission
There is no "submission" for the Team Activity. Make sure you have your notes for the meeting (can be a doc in the files section) in your team's meeting channel. The TAs will check the attendance logs and award points based on attendance and completed notes.
